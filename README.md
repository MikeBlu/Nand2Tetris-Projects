# Nand2Tetris-Projects
This repository encompasses all the primary projects (1-8) from Part 1 &amp; Part 2 of the Nand2Tetris course, Hack Computer Hardware (Hack HDL), Hack assembler (Python), &amp; Vm-Translator (Python) implemented by me (following the specifications as described by Simon Schocken and Noam Nisan, of Hebrew University of Jerusalem).

All Projects are labeled based on the order in which they respectively appear in the full Nand2Tetris syllabus, going from Hardware -> Software.

This was a very fun & informative interactive experience into the inner workings of basic computer hardware and software implementation; I have a great deal of respect for the various minds behind and shared-knowledge that went into the general Computer -- and designing the architectural-groundwork that evolved into modern Operating Systems.
